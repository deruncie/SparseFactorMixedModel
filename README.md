### Version history

#### V1.0
Published version in MATLAB
on website: [](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~sayan/bfgr/index.shtml)
- includes Ayroles_et_al_Competitive_fitness, Simulations with half-sib design
- should be able to replicate all analyses from paper (up to Monte-carlo error in Gibbs and in simulations)

#### V1.1
- Fixed calculation of genetic and interaction specific effects. The calculation and corresponding text of the paper missed $A^{-1}$. 
This mistake, as well as other errors in the paper are documented [here](Correction/Correction_items.pdf). 
A re-analysis of the simulations presented in the paper and an updated Appendix are presented [here](Correction/Corrected_Appendix.pdf).

#### V2.0
Nearly complete re-write of the model code, but should maintain identical function \
- variables have been re-named to more closely correspond to the paper
- sampler function has been re-written to only sample.
- A new function initializes the sampler, only run once
- sampler function starts where the previous run left off (including maintaining the random number generator), so should be the same as running one continuous chain

#### R_BSFG V2.0
R clone of V2.0 Matlab code
- Functionality should be identical. Worth checking. Note that the RNG is different.
- embeded in the Gibbs sampler are two versions of each sampler function, a native R version, and a Rcpp version. They should be identical (up to RNG differences). The Rcpp function has the same name and arguments, but with "_c" appended to the function name.
