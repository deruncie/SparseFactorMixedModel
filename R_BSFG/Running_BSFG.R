# Run MCMC
# see ?sample_BSFG
# A MCMC chain is a way of fitting parameters from a Bayesian model
# The chain is a sequence of draws from the Posterior distribution of each parameter.
# BSFG uses a Gibbs sampler, which means that we iterate through all of the model's parameters
# and for each parameter draw a new value from it's posterior holding all other parameters constant
# This works, but the individual draws are not independent draws from the joint posterior of all parameters.
# Therefore, to get independent draws, we have to collect many posterior samples, and then save only a portion of them.
# Also, it may take many iterations for the MCMC chain to converge to the central part of the distribution.
# This is the burnin period, and we do not store these values (they are not useful).
# At the end, we have a collection of samples from the posterior distribution of each parameter.
# We can use these samples to characterize each distribution: mean, SD, histogram, HPDinterval, etc.
#
# The way BSFG works is that you ask the program to collect a small number of samples
# And then can assess how the chain is performing (how well it is mixing, is it converged?)
# And then either save the samples as posterior samples, or declare them as burn-in and discard them.
# Then, you can ask for more samples, and repeat until you have enough.
