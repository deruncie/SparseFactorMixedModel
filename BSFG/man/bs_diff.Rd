\title{B spline basis with option of centering and differencing coefficients}
\usage{
bs_diff(x, df = NULL, knots = NULL, degree = 3, intercept = TRUE,
  Boundary.knots = range(x), differences = 1, periodic = FALSE,
  center = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{center}{}
}
\description{
parameters follow \link{bs}
}
\details{
uses code from \link{bs}, but optionally transforms the basis into a difference
between spline parameters.

Also, optionally centers the spline so that the spline average is zero.
