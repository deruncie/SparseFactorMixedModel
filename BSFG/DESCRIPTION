Title: Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis of Mixed Models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel E Runcie
Maintainer: Daniel E Runcie <druncie@ucdavis.edu>
Description: Efficient implementation the Bayesian Sparse Factor Mixed effects model, based on the 
    model described by Runcie and Mukherjee (2013) Genetics.
    This package implements an improved Gibbs sampling algorithm relative to the one described in 
    the manuscript, and adds the ability to model multiple random effects efficiently - 
    both for the factors and the residuals.
